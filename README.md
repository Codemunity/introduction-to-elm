# Introduction to Elm

This repository holds the source code for our *Introduction to Elm* course.

You'll find a branch for each of the videos that involves coding.

## Running the Samples

The first exercise isn't "runnable", it's just a demonstration of the most basic syntax in Elm. You can run the rest of the branches in several ways, we recommend two, if you don't have Elm installed, the easiest way is to copy the contents of the `Main.elm` file into the `Elm` tab in [Ellie](https://ellie-app.com/new) and simply click `Compile`. If you have Elm installed, you just have to run `elm-reactor`, open `localhost:8000/Main.elm` in your browser and that should do the trick.
